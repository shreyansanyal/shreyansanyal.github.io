 <h1>Hi! I am Shreyan.</h1>
    
    <p> I work on n-dimensional signal processing, primarily on 
        image processing (focusing on quality assessment and segmentation).
         A computer vision engineer by trade, my experience touches everything 
         from signal processing to natural language processing, information retrieval, 
         machine learning and data science.</p>
        
    <p> On the personal side - I am from Kolkata, India. When I am not coding, or 
        reading research papers - I am usually painting, playing chess, hiking or 
        cooking. You can probably find out more about me if you check out the links below.
         Or if you want a detailed CV, you can find it here. </p>
